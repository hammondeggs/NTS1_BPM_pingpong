# NTS1_BPM_pingpong
A BPM-sync'd ping-pong delay for your KORG NTS-1 synthesizer

This is a (hopefully) well commented example of creating a BPM-style delay for your KORG NTS-1 synthesizer. The prologue and minilogue-xd synthesizers already come with this style of delay - yet the NTS-1 does not. 

This particular flavour of this delay is "pingpong" - this means, the delay will bounce back and forth between the two channels.


Place these files in your logue-sdk delfx\tests folder e.g.

```...logue-sdk\platform\nutekt-digital\delfx\tests\bpmdelay_pingpong ```

Feel free to modify and create your own variations etc - try adding filters etc!

Have fun;
